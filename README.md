# ODIN-SCHOOL-Bootcamp

Welcome to my ODIN-SCHOOL-Bootcamp repository! This is the home of my Data Science journey and showcases my achievements during my Data Science Professional certification at ODIN-SCHOOL.

## Capstone Project

### Description
In this repository, you'll find my Capstone Project, a culmination of my data science skills. I tackled real-world challenges and applied data science techniques to derive meaningful insights.

### Capstone Project Details
- **Title**: Credit Card Approval Analysis
- **Objective**: The objective of the Credit Card Approval Analysis project is to leverage data science and machine learning techniques to assess and predict credit card approval outcomes.
-  This project aims to: Create a one of the Best Credit Card Approval Model
- **Tools Used**: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn

- **Notebook**: [Link to Capstone IPython Notebook](https://github.com/rajkulhade/ODIN-SCHOOL-Bootcamp/blob/main/02.%20Credit%20Card%20Approval%20Project/Credit%20Card%20Analsyis%20By%20Raj%20Kulhade.ipynb)

## Projects

### Minor Project: Diabetes Dataset Analysis
- **Description**: In my minor project, I analyzed the Diabetes dataset to gain insights into diabetes prevalence and factors contributing to it. I applied various data science techniques to extract meaningful information from the data.

### Major Project: Credit Card Approval Analysis
- **Description**: My major project focused on analyzing credit card approval data. I delved into factors affecting credit card approvals and built predictive models to assess creditworthiness. This project demonstrates my ability to make data-driven decisions.
